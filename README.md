# Sentiment_Analysis
This code enables for scraping data from the website and perform Text Analysis on the blogs scraped from the respective sites. The score after the analysis are then stored in an excel file.

The 'scrape_and_analysis.py' file contains the scraper, the analysis part and it also saves the file in an excel file.
For better understanding of the code, I would recommend checking the :-
  'scraper.py':- for the Web-Scraping part
  'complete_analysis.py':- for the Sentiment Analysis part
for the main code('scrape_and_analysis.py').


Any imporovements to the code will be welcomed.
